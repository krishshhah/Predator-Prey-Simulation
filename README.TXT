A predator-prey simulation involving an ecosystem of underwater animals in
an enclosed rectangular field. Animals eat, move, kill, sleep, etc.

This is the second version of the simulation. This version
makes use of inheritance for the animals.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 700 steps.
